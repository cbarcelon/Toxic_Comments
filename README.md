# Toxic Comments Challenge from kaggle

This is a repository of the files I used to compete in the Toxic Comment Challenge.  The models used coded in python and run in Jupyter Notebooks.  

The Project report describes the development process for the initial model I used to compete in the competition.
# Install
To run the code from the notebooks the csv files will need to be downloaded from the kaggle website
